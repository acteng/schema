# schema

<!-- badges: start -->

The goal of schema is to provide a basis for prototyping and a schema to map existing and planned infrastructure for active travel planning.
Eventually, the intention is for this repo to also contain associated tools and code/documentation to make the schema easy to use for everyone wanting to map active travel infrastructure in a consistent way that is friendly for data providers and as useful as possible for people using the data.

## Introduction

Database schemas define the 'shape' that series of datasets can take.
They are often visualised in database diagrams such as the image below.

Having such a schema offers advantages:

-   Consistency between different users (local authorities, researchers, consultancies, other users)
-   Supporting people generating new plans to think about the data they may need to collect
-   Future-proofness: an evolving schema with empty fields that may become useful encourages datasets to be kept up-to-date
