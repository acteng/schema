# schema

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of schema is to provide a basis for prototyping and a schema to map existing and planned infrastructure for active travel planning.
Eventually, the intention is for this repo to also contain associated tools and code/documentation to make the schema easy to use for everyone wanting to map active travel infrastructure in a consistent way that is friendly for data providers and as useful as possible for people using the data.

## Introduction

Database schemas define the 'shape' that series of datasets can take.
They are often visualised in database diagrams such as the image below.

Having such a schema offers advantages:

-   Consistency between different users (local authorities, researchers, consultancies, other users)
-   Supporting people generating new plans to think about the data they may need to collect
-   Future-proofness: an evolving schema with empty fields that may become useful encourages datasets to be kept up-to-date

## An example schema

A basic example of a schema for active travel infrastructure is shown below.

In this schema, there are three tables representing neteworks, routes and ways.
The ways represent the individual segments that, in combination, form routes.
In turn, many routes can add-up to represent a network.
Networks could cover an entire city or be small, e.g. to represent the travel network in a particular neighbourhood.

## Schema versioning

Just like software used to process data, data formats, and the underlying schemas that define them, should evolve over time.
To extend the schema above we can add more fields such as MinWidth and MaxWidth and add another table, representing point features on the network.
This updated schema is illustrated below.

In the future the schema could evolve further.
Versioning the schema will ensure backwards compatibility and encourage innovation.

## Existing active travel infrastructure schemas

### TfL's Cycling Infrastructure Database (CID)

```{r get_cid_once, eval=FALSE}
library(osmdata)
remotes::install_github("PublicHealthDataGeek/CycleInfraLnd")
?CycleInfraLnd::get_cid_lines
blackfriars_bridge_road = opq(bbox = "London") |> 
  add_osm_feature(key = "name", value = "Blackfriars Bridge") |> 
  osmdata_sf() |> 
  pluck("osm_multilines")
blackfriars_buffer = sf::st_buffer(blackfriars_bridge_road, 500)
mapview::mapview(blackfriars_bridge_road)
cid_cycle_lane_track = CycleInfraLnd::get_cid_lines(type = "cycle_lane_track")
cid_cycle_lane_track_blackfriars = cid_cycle_lane_track[blackfriars_buffer, , op = sf::st_within]
dir.create("example_data")
sf::write_sf(cid_cycle_lane_track_blackfriars, "example_data/cid_cycle_lane_track_blackfriars.geojson")
tm_shape(cid_cycle_lane_track_blackfriars) +
  tm_lines()
```

```{r}
cid_cycle_lane_track_blackfriars = sf::read_sf("example_data/cid_cycle_lane_track_blackfriars.geojson")
cid_cycle_lane_track_blackfriars |> slice(1:3)
```
